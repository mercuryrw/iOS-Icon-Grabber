# iOS-Icon-Grabber

A basic python 3 script to download an app icon from the Apple App Store as a 512x512 jpg image.

Run the script either in IDLE or on the command line using: "python iOs-Icon-Grabber.py"

To get the app id for an app, visit the itunes website on a computer and find the app you want the icon for. The URL should resemble the following:
```
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/<APPNAME>/id<APPID>?mt=8
```

This script takes the app id part of the URL as it's input.

Enjoy!
